The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory

Steps 
1. Enter product id to order 
2. Enter quantity to order 
3. You will see the total price 
4. If not enough quantity in the inventory you will get notification of insufficient inventory 


Remaining work:
1. I would like to update the database and inventory everytime product requested 
2. Once database updated would like to request again (easy work)
